This is BMVis, an interactive graph visualization program.

An automatically generated build script is available for use with
Apache Ant.  Alternatively, you can build BMVis within NetBeans by
opening the provided project file.

BMVis depends on bmgraph-java, which is available at
https://github.com/DiscoveryGroup/bmgraph-java.  The build script
assumes that bmgraph-java source is located in a sibling directory
bmgraph-java.  In other words, if BMVis sources are at
/parent/dir/bmvis, bmgraph-java sources are looked in
/parent/dir/bmgraph-java.
