This is BMVis, an interactive graph visualization program.

BMVis depends on bmgraph-java, which is available at
https://github.com/DiscoveryGroup/bmgraph-java.

When bmgraph-java is installed into the local artifact repository,
one can build bmvis simply by running Maven:
  mvn package
or alternatively use some other build system and include the
bmgraph-java sources in the build.  The classes need to be there
at both compile and at run time.  In addition to bmgraph-java,
BMVis depends on the included prefuse.jar JAR-file in the lib
directory.  The provided Maven build uses another (?) version from
the global artifact repository.
